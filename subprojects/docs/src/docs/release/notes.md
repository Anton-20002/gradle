The Gradle team is pleased to announce Gradle 4.9.

First and foremost, this version of Gradle features experimental new [lazy task APIs](userguide/task_configuration_avoidance.html).
Gradle can now _avoid configuring tasks_ that are not invoked when using these lazy task APIs, making your builds and IDE sync times faster. 

We have been testing this feature at scale and have seen 10-15% faster configuration times.

You will see configuration times reduced more and more as Gradle tasks are converted to use them.
Gradle task and plugin authors should read [the documentation](userguide/task_configuration_avoidance.html) to learn how to get started using this exciting new feature.

Next, publishing tools get some more love: projects that publish auxiliary publications (e.g. test fixtures) through `maven-publish` and `ivy-publish` can now be depended upon by other projects in the same build.
There is also a [new Publishing Overview chapter](/userguide/publishing_overview.html) in the user manual and updates throughout the documentation regarding publishing artifacts using Maven and Ivy.

In addition to lazy tasks use, Kotlin DSL build scripts are evaluated faster with version 0.18.4, included in this version of Gradle.
IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio user experience is also improved.
See details in the [Kotlin DSL v0.18.x release notes](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/releases/tag/v0.18.4).

You can now pass arguments to `JavaExec` tasks [directly from the command-line](#command-line-args-supported-by-javaexec) using `--args`:

    ❯ gradle run --args 'foo --bar'
    
No more need to hard-code arguments in your build scripts. 
Consult the documentation for the [Application Plugin](userguide/application_plugin.html#sec:application_usage) for more information.

Last but not least, this version of Gradle has an _improved dependency insight report_. Read the [details further on](#improved-dependency-insight-report).   

We hope you will build happiness with Gradle 4.9, and we look forward to your feedback [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/gradle) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/gradle).

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 4.9 RC1 quickly by updating your wrapper properties:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=4.9-rc-1`

Standalone downloads are available at [gradle.org/release-candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate). 

## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Command line args supported by JavaExec

Command line arguments can be passed to `JavaExec` with `--args`. For example, if you want to launch the application with command line arguments `foo --bar`,
you don't need to hardcode it into the build script - you can just run `gradle run --args 'foo --bar'`.
See the [Application Plugin documentation](userguide/application_plugin.html#sec:application_usage) for more information.

### Improved dependency insight report

The [dependency insight report](/userguide/inspecting_dependencies.html#sec:identifying_reason_dependency_selection) is the distant ancestor of [build scans](https://scans.gradle.com) and helps you diagnose dependency management problems locally.
This release of Gradle implements several improvements:

- using `failOnVersionConflict()` no longer fails the dependency insight report in case of conflict
- all participants of conflict resolution are shown
- modules which were rejected by a rule are displayed
- modules which didn't match the version selector but were considered in selection are shown
- all custom reasons for a component selection are shown
- ability to restrict the report to one path to each dependency, for readability
- resolution failures are displayed in the report

### Continuing development of Native ecosystem

[The Gradle Native project continues](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/blob/master/docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md#changes-included-in-gradle-49) to improve and evolve the native ecosystem support for Gradle.

### Faster clean checkout builds

Gradle now stores more state in the Gradle user home instead of the project directory. Clean checkout builds on CI should now be faster as long as the user home is preserved.

### Java and Groovy compiler no longer leak file descriptors

The Java and Groovy compilers both used to leak file descriptors when run in-process (which is the default).
This could lead to "cannot delete file" exceptions on Windows and "too many open file descriptors" on Unix.
These leaks have been fixed.  If you had switched to forking mode because of this problem, it is now safe to switch back to in-process compilation.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

### Dependency insight report

The dependency insight report is now considered stable.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### `EclipseProject` tasks defined for `gradle eclipse` may now run in Buildship

The [EclipseClasspath](dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseClasspath.html) and [EclipseProject](dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseProject.html) tasks both accept `beforeMerged` and `whenMerged` closures, for advanced Eclipse-specific customisation.

Previous versions of Gradle did not execute the closures defined in `EclipseProject` when invoked from Buildship (only those in `EclipseClasspath`). Now Gradle executes them both, similarly to when invoked from the command-line.

This leads to a potential change of behavior in this scenario:
 - These closures were defined for use with `gradle eclipse`
 - The gradle project was later imported into Eclipse, but these definitions were not removed.

The code in these closures will now become active in the `Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project` action.

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->

### Using Groovy GPath with `tasks.withType()`

In previous versions of Gradle, it was sometimes possible to use a [GPath](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#gpath_expressions) expression with a project's task collection to build a list of a single property for all tasks.

For instance, `tasks.withType(SomeTask).name` would create a list of `String`s containing all of the names of tasks of type `SomeTask`. This was only possible with the method [`TaskCollection.withType(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskCollection.html#withType-java.lang.Class-).

Plugins or build scripts attempting to do this will now get a runtime exception.  The easiest fix is to explicitly use the [spread operator](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#_spread_operator).
